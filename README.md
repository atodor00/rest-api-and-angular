# rest-api-and-angular

my-app is from tutorial    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dHNOWTI7H8
with small changes

in tutorial is used json-server

but i decided to make my own first rest api
with node.js and express


there is also a .env file that should be in my-api
with a url constant
with it you can connect to a mongo db
